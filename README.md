## AuthPage

### Overview

The `AuthPage` is a stateless widget that serves as the authentication entry point for the application. It utilizes Firebase Authentication to manage user sessions and Firestore to store user-related data. The page dynamically updates based on the user's authentication state, providing a seamless experience for both logged-in and unauthenticated users.

### Features

- **Real-time Authentication State Monitoring**: The `AuthPage` listens for changes in the user's authentication state using Firebase's `authStateChanges()` stream.
- **User Record Management**: Automatically checks if a user record exists in Firestore upon login and creates one if it does not, ensuring that user data is initialized correctly.
- **Navigation**: Redirects users to the appropriate page based on their authentication statusâ€”either the home page for logged-in users or the login/registration page for unauthenticated users.

## HomePage

### Overview

The `HomePage` class is a stateless widget that serves as the main interface for users after logging in. It displays categories and best-selling products, integrating with Firestore to fetch relevant data.

### Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Displays items marked to be shown on the home page.
- **Firestore Integration**: Queries the `items` collection to retrieve document IDs based on the `isShownOnHomePage` field.
- **User Navigation**: Provides a bottom navigation bar for easy access to the home page, shopping bag, and user profile.

### Methods

#### `Future<List<String>> getDocumentIdsShownOnHomePage()`

- Fetches document IDs from Firestore where `isShownOnHomePage` is set to 1.
- Returns a list of document IDs.

#### `void _onItemTapped(BuildContext context, int index)`

- Handles navigation based on the tapped index in the bottom navigation bar.
- Navigates to the `HomePage`, `MyBag`, or `ProfileScreen`.

#### `@override Widget build(BuildContext context)`

- Constructs the UI for the `HomePage`.
- Utilizes a `FutureBuilder` to manage asynchronous data fetching.
- Displays loading indicators, error messages, or the main content based on the data state.

## CustomBottomNavigationBar

### Overview

The `CustomBottomNavigationBar` class is a stateless widget that provides a customizable bottom navigation bar for the application. It allows users to navigate between different sections of the app, such as Home, Bag, and Profile.

### Features

- **Dynamic Selection**: Highlights the currently selected item based on the `selectedIndex` parameter.
- **Customizable Callback**: Accepts a callback function `onItemTapped` to handle navigation when an item is tapped.
- **Consistent Design**: Uses a fixed type bottom navigation bar with a black background and white icons for a cohesive look.

### Constructor

- **Parameters**:
  - `selectedIndex`: An integer representing the currently selected index of the navigation items.
  - `onItemTapped`: A function that takes an integer as an argument, used to handle item tap events.

### Build Method

- Constructs the `BottomNavigationBar` widget with:
  - A black background color.
  - White color for selected items and a lighter shade for unselected items.
  - Three fixed items: Home, Bag, and Profile, each represented by an icon and a label.
  - The `currentIndex` is set to the value of `selectedIndex`, ensuring the correct item is highlighted.
  - The `onTap` property is linked to the `onItemTapped` function to facilitate navigation.

## CategoryGrid

### Overview

The `CategoryGrid` class is a stateless widget that displays a grid of categories fetched from Firestore. It utilizes a `FutureBuilder` to handle asynchronous data retrieval and dynamically updates the UI based on the data state.

### Features

- **Data Fetching**: Retrieves category documents from the Firestore `categories` collection.
- **Dynamic UI**: Displays categories in a grid format, adjusting based on the number of documents retrieved.
- **Error Handling**: Manages loading states, errors, and empty data scenarios gracefully.

### Methods

#### `Future<List<DocumentSnapshot>> getCategoryDocuments()`

- Fetches category documents from Firestore and returns a list of `DocumentSnapshot` objects.

#### `@override Widget build(BuildContext context)`

- Constructs the UI for the `CategoryGrid`.
- Uses a `FutureBuilder` to manage the asynchronous fetching of category data.
- Displays a loading indicator while data is being fetched.
- Handles errors and empty data cases, logging relevant information.
- Renders a grid of `CategoryItem` widgets based on the retrieved category documents.

## BestSellerHeader

### Overview

The `BestSellerHeader` class is a stateless widget that displays a header for the best-selling products section of the application.

### Features

- **Static Header**: Displays a fixed title "Best Sellers" to indicate the section of best-selling products.
- **Custom Styling**: Utilizes a specific font family, size, weight, and color.

### Methods

- **Search Functionality**: Includes a text field for user input, allowing users to search for items within the app.
- **Dynamic Height**: The height of the app bar is adjustable, accommodating additional elements as needed.

### Methods

#### `@override Widget build(BuildContext context)`

- Constructs the UI for the `CustomAppBar`.
- Utilizes a `TextEditingController` to manage the input for the search field.
- Organizes the layout using a `Column` to evenly distribute space between the title and the search field.
- The search field includes:
  - A hint text prompting the user to enter a search query.
  - A search icon for visual indication.
  - An `onSubmitted` callback that navigates to the `SearchPage` with the user's query when the search is submitted.

#### `@override Size get preferredSize`

- Returns the preferred size of the app bar, which is set to accommodate the standard toolbar height plus additional space for the custom elements.

## SearchPage

### Overview

The `SearchPage` class is a stateful widget that provides a user interface for searching items within the application. It allows users to input search queries and displays the results in a grid format.

- **Loading Indicator**: Displays a loading spinner while search results are being fetched.
- **Error Handling**: Manages potential errors during the search process gracefully.

### Constructor

- **Parameters**:
  - `searchInput`: A string that initializes the search field with a predefined query.

### State Management

#### `_SearchPageState`

- **Attributes**:
  - `searchResults`: A list of tuples containing search results, where each tuple holds a priority and a document ID.
  - `isLoading`: A boolean indicating whether the search results are currently being loaded.
  - `searchController`: A `TextEditingController` for managing the input in the search field.

#### `initState()`

- Initializes the `searchController` with the provided `searchInput` and triggers the search operation.

#### `Future<void> _performSearch()`

- Executes the search based on the current input in the search field.
- Updates the `isLoading` state to reflect the search status.
- Fetches search results asynchronously and updates the state accordingly.

- A simple helper class to represent a tuple containing two items, used to store search result priorities and document IDs.

### Search Function

#### `Future<List<Tuple<int, String>>> search(String query)`

- Searches the Firestore `items` collection for documents matching the provided query.
- Converts the query to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
- Iterates through each document and checks if any field matches the query, assigning a priority based on the match type.
