## AuthPage

### Overview

The `AuthPage` is a stateless widget that serves as the authentication entry point for the application. It utilizes Firebase Authentication to manage user sessions and Firestore to store user-related data. The page dynamically updates based on the user's authentication state, providing a seamless experience for both logged-in and unauthenticated users.

### Features

- **Real-time Authentication State Monitoring**: The `AuthPage` listens for changes in the user's authentication state using Firebase's `authStateChanges()` stream.
- **User Record Management**: Automatically checks if a user record exists in Firestore upon login and creates one if it does not, ensuring that user data is initialized correctly.
- **Navigation**: Redirects users to the appropriate page based on their authentication statusâ€”either the home page for logged-in users or the login/registration page for unauthenticated users.
